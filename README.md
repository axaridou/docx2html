# docx2html
docx2html is a native java library that provides an API for breaking a single docx-file (or a folder that contains multiple docx-files), taken from the local file system, into distinct html-section-files. The aim of this process is the automatic segmentation and extraction of parts of docx-files, based on format characteristics.
